2.3 Rule Based System Reflection
________________________________

I love reading and reading every night before bed, I am always starting a new book and to my husbandâ€™s dismay buying 
new books for me at home library. My rule-based system works by asking the user some basic questions
about their reading preferences, including genre, mood, book length, age group, and reading purpose. Each answer 
is stored, and then the system applies a set of IF-THEN rules to determine the most relevant recommendation. This 
allows readers to easily find books within a predetermined library of suggestions and decide what the next good read
will be. The recommendation process does not rely on randomness or machine learning and follows clearly structured 
logical rules.

One of the challenges I faced while working on this project was figuring out how to structure the rules, so they were readable
and functional. I had to rely on nested conditionals and dictionaries to capture different combinations of user responses. I 
also had a couple of issues setting up my GitHub. I was able to login and connect VS Code with my GitHub account, but once it 
was time to commit and push the assignment up to GitHub, I began seeing multiple errors (which became overwhelming to deal with).

Using AI to collaborate helped when I did run into challenges and helped me get the structure of my project set up in a way 
that looked nice and organized. AI was able to give me appropriate examples of IF-THEN rules to help me move through my Recommendation
System. It streamlined the process, helped me find issues within my code, and helped troubleshoot the errors I would run into when 
needed. Occasionally I would have to reword my questions or have it explain a little further in detail or show more examples to know 
what to do next since VS Code and WSL are slightly different from other software I have used in the past, but overall, once all issues were 
addressed and fixed it was a smooth process.
