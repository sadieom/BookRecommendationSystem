📘 Project Report: Book Recommendation System

PART 1:

*Rule Based Recommendations System  ✅ (chosen)
Concept: Suggest items (books, music, recipes, etc.) based on hardcoded preferences.
Ask questions about preferences, then apply rules to narrow down the options.
Why it’s good: Shows early recommender logic without algorithms.
What it does:
Suggests books or movies to the user based on their preferences like genre, mood, or length.
 How it works using rules:
The system stores predefined rules mapping preferences to recommendations. For example:
•	If genre = fantasy and mood = adventurous → recommend The Hobbit.
•	If genre = sci-fi and length = short → recommend Arrival (movie) or The Martian Chronicles (book).
User answers a series of questions, and the rules select the most fitting match.

*Personal Finance Advisor
Concept: Gives savings or spending advice based on income, expenses, and goals.
Example rules:
•	If expenses > income → "Reduce non-essential spending."
•	If savings < 10% of income → "Increase your monthly savings."
It could also suggest budgeting tips or investments.
 What it does:
Gives basic budgeting, saving, and spending advice based on a user’s income, expenses, and savings goals.
How it works using rules:
Uses if–then logic to compare user financial data to target thresholds. For example:
•	If expenses > income → suggest “Reduce non-essential spending.”
•	If savings < 10% of income → suggest “Increase your monthly savings.”
•	If debt > 50% of income → suggest “Prioritize paying off high-interest debt.”

*Plant Care Advisor
Concept: Gives tips for plants based on species, seasons, and soil moisture.
Example rules:
•	If plant = “cactus” and moisture > 50% → “Reduce watering.”
•	If plant = “orchid” and humidity < 40% → “Increase humidity.”
What it does:
Recommends watering, sunlight, and care tips for plants based on species, seasons, and soil moisture.


I will be choosing to do the recommendation system for books. I am an avid reader, and I always get stuck on 
what I should read next once I finish a book, this system should help eliminate the huge decision making.

PART 2: Rules/Logic
Rule-Based Book Recommendation Logic
1. Mood Rules
•	IF mood = "happy"
THEN select from cheerful, lighthearted, or uplifting books.
•	IF mood = "sad"
THEN select from comforting, empathetic, or hopeful books.
•	IF mood = "adventurous"
THEN select from action-packed, fantasy, or exploration books.
•	IF mood = "romantic"
THEN select from love stories, emotional dramas, or feel-good romances.
•	IF mood = "curious"
THEN select from educational, thought-provoking, or non-fiction books.
•	IF mood = "reflective"
THEN select from deep, philosophical, or life-exploring books.

2. Reading Level Rules
•	IF level = "beginner"
THEN recommend simple, easy-to-read books with straightforward plots.
•	IF level = "intermediate"
THEN recommend books with moderate complexity in language and themes.
•	IF level = "advanced"
THEN recommend books with rich vocabulary, layered themes, or classics.

3. Length Preference Rules
•	IF length = "short"
THEN recommend short novels, novellas, or quick reads.
•	IF length = "medium"
THEN recommend books of standard novel length (200–400 pages).
•	IF length = "long"
THEN recommend epic novels, series, or lengthy reads.


4. Combination Rules
•	IF mood + level + length all match a set of books in the knowledge base
THEN recommend those matching books.
•	IF no exact match exists
THEN broaden the search by relaxing length first, then level, keeping mood as the highest priority.
